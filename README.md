# Picto PlantUML integration

Picto is a framework for model visualisation via model-to-text transformation. This repo used to host plugins that extend Picto with support for [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com). These plugins have now been moved to the main [Epsilon development branch](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/articles/picto/).
